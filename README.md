# Machine learning-based prediction of monthly market direction

## Introduction
The purpose is to investigate the possibility to use machine learning to predict the short-term direction (up or down) of an equity fund. The dataset used is historical monthly data for the ETF EQQQ Nasdaq 100. The model should predict whether the next month's closing price will be higher or lower than the current one.
